    <h1>The Double Slit Experiment: Strange Particles</h1>
    <div>
    <p>
        The Double Slit Experiment is one of the most perplexing mysteries in the field of quantum physics. Imagine you have a light source coming from one side of a wall and there are two slits carved into it. The slits act as a passage for the light on one side of the wall to move through. The light squeezes and contracts itself as it moves through the slits, emerging on the other side almost like another source of light. The light on this side of the wall hits a screen, exhibiting wave-like patterns upon the screen. This demonstrates interference.

        This, in itself, is not the strange part. But, when repeating the same experiment with tiny particles, like atoms, they pass through one slit or the other. When one slit is blocked off, they go through the other slit. At this point, we begin to see the same pattern on the screen behind the wall as we did with the light in the first experiment.

        Finally, when sending the atoms through one at a time they look scattered on the screen behind the wall.

        But, as we progress and send more and more atoms through the slits, even two at a time, they begin to exhibit the same wave like pattern like the original experiment with light. Almost as if the atoms are contributing to some bigger picture, even when going through one at a time. Essentially, the atoms seem to behave as if they are aware of the number of slits in the wall and act accordingly to create the same pattern.
